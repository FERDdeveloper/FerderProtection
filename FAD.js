//AntiDDOS protection, coded with clever ddesing, and good knowledge about Java/JavaScript
//Meaning: if system registers DDOS attack it does the things inside the "{}"
if(System.registeredDDOS()) {
    do {
        //stops DDOS attack in 0.7 seconds, however this can be changed to lower time
        System.stopDDOS( .inTime(0.7));
    }
}
//Important: This only works for websites(or discord bots)
